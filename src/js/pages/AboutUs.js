        <p>The Friends of the Windsor and Royal Borough Museum was formed in 1991 to campaign and raise money for a museum in Windsor, which would be dedicated to the town and the people of Windsor.</p>
        <p>This initial aim was acheived in March 2011 when Windsorâ€™s Guildhall Museum opened. The Friends now exists to promote and support the work of the museum by providing volunteers to assist the work of the museum's curatorial staff and to guide visitors to the Museum. Furthermore the Friends continue to raise money to fund new aquisitions for the Museum.</p>
        <p>The Friends also organises a programme of talks and social events for its members.</p>
        <p>By working with and supporting other like-minded organisations in the local area, the Friends also promotes the history and cultural heritage of the whole of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.</p>
